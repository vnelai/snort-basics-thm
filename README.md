# 🧠 Snort Basics – TryHackMe Lab Walkthrough

This repo contains my full walkthrough of the [Snort Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/snortbasics) room on TryHackMe.

I wrote custom Snort rules, analyzed PCAPs, troubleshot rule syntax and logic, and detected real-world exploits like MS17-010 and Log4Shell.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `rules/` – All Snort rule files per task
- `walkthrough/` – Detailed task write-ups with answers and command logic
- `pcaps/` – Instructions to download required PCAP files (see below)
- `cheatsheet.md` – Tips on Snort syntax, alert modes, and rule troubleshooting

## 🚀 Skills Practiced

- IDS rule writing from scratch
- Detecting FTP/HTTP traffic patterns
- Finding magic byte signatures (PNG, GIF)
- Tuning rules to detect payloads
- Debugging broken rule files
- Using Snort to detect MS17-010 and Log4Shell exploits

## 📦 PCAP Files

Due to licensing and lab policy, PCAP files are not included in this repo.

You can download them directly by completing the room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/snortbasics) and navigating to each task folder.
